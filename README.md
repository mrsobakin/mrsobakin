This is probably the language I wrote most code in. It is slow as hell, is full of runtime exceptions, but it's simple and gets the job done. This readme was generated using Python!

Surprising to see a game in a tech stack, right? But there's a good reason why it's here - Minecraft was the main reason that brought me into computer science. It teached me the art of kludging, and I even decided to learn to code just so I could make mods for it. Needless to say that I still didn't made a single one :)" height="32"></picture>
